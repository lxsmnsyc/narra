# Calibration

| Roadmap | Node | Estimate | Actual | Review rounds | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| selfhost | split-compiler | M | M | 2 | Round 1 found two changed error messages that no test covered. |
| selfhost | bench-harness | M | M | 2 | Round 1 found an all-skipped row that reported ok. |
| selfhost | modules | L | L | 2 | Round 1 found types compared by name only across modules, and a C name collision through `__`. |
| selfhost | traits | L | L | 2 | Built in parallel with modules, then rebased onto it. Rounds found a constructor lookup that depended on map order, an implementation name collision, and function types that never unified. |
